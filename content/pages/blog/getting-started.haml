%h1 Getting Started
%p
  Nesta Boilerplate is simple to setup and comes with baked-in support for [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) (and Sass/Haml), [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/Documentation-v2.x) with semi-optional support for [HTML Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [Semantic GS](http://semantic.gs/).

%p
  First things first, learn about [Nesta](http://nestacms.com/) then get started like so:
/ <pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
/   $ git clone git@github.com:briangonzalez/nesta-boilerplate.git
/   $ cd nesta-boilerplate
/   $ bundle
/   $ shotgun config.ru
/ </pre> 

:coderay
  #!ruby
  $ git clone git@github.com:briangonzalez/nesta-boilerplate.git
  $ cd nesta-boilerplate
  $ bundle
  $ shotgun config.ru

%p
  Then point your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:9393/](http://127.0.0.1:9393/). And voila, you're rockin' some _Nesta Boilerplate_ goodness.

%p
  By default, Capistrano is setup to deploy from your current directory, no need to setup a git repo if you don't want. Read the docs on github to find out how.

%p
Also, you'll want to edit `config/deploy.rb` with all of your server-specific info.

%h2 Using Git for Deployment

%p
  If you'd like to use Git to deploy your Nesta site, rename `deploy.git.rb` to `deploy.rb` and delete/ or rename the other `deploy.rb` to `deploy.old.rb`. Lastly, rename the folder `deploy.git` to simply `deploy`, then you can:

:coderay
  #!ruby
  $ cap deploy                  // deploy to stage, or...
  $ cap production deploy       // deploy to production

  ## What you get from Nesta Boilerplate

  ### Baked-In

  * Compass
  * Capistrano 

  ### Semi-Optional

  * HTML5 Boilerplate 
  * jQuery
  * Semantic Grid System

  By using Nesta Boilerplate, you get by default Compass & Capistrano configured and ready to go. I recommend modifying or installing your own theme by replacing/deleting what's in 

:coderay
  #!ruby
  themes/nestabp-theme

:markdown
  with your own theme. The theme is basically a convenience for those wanting HTML5 Boilerplate, jQuery, and a responsive grid -- a common paradigm in web development. The theme is built on essentially 10 lines of CSS, so do what you will with it.
